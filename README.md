# AI Text Detection
##ECGR 4106/5106 (Real Time Machine Learning) final project under the supervision of Dr. Hamed Tabkhi. This project aims to classify the origin of a tweet as an AI generated text or a human written one.

Due to the rise of high-level and easily accessible natural language processing (NLP) models such as OpenAI’s GPT or Google’s Bard, there has been a rising concern that the technology will be used in negative ways, such as plagiarism or the generation of misinformation. Particularly with misinformation, there is a real danger in the domain of both news and politics, as a model could be trained for tasks such as writing a fake news article, or even a fake speech from an important figure, such as a global leader. 

As social media such as Twitter or Facebook  behaves as a large gathering place online, it poses itself as a prime target for the dissemination of such misinformation. One way to combat this would be the development of a methodology to generate a text authentication system, which can quickly and accurately determine whether a text is a genuine human creation, or an AI generated text.
